# Angular Components Library

A great set of reusable `@angular` components, directives and testing utilities.

One of our main goals is to allow easy integration with the great collection of components already provided by the `@angular/material` team and to build everything with the following in mind:

- ü§ò a11y
- üöÄ performance
- üíñ look and feel

# Git Conventions

### Commit Messages

We initially started off by using a `custom` commit message convention, now that we've gone OS, we realize it will be much easier for everyone if we adhere to the `conventional-commit` standard.

The project comes preconfigured with `commitlint` and `husky` hooks in order to automate checks.

Another advantage of `conventional-commits` is that it will allow us to later on integrate `semantic-release` with ease.

### Conflict Resolution

We all know that once you open a `PR`, it sometimes goes through a rigorous code review process. Sometimes, due to this delay, we end up with a `PR` that has `conflicts`.

In this scenarios, we're usually used to either `merge` or `rebase`.

We personally prefer that branches get `rebased`, and usually stay away from `merge` commits as they mostly end up polluting the history needlessly. At this point, most of you are probabily thinking: `Yeah, but it's not a good practice to rebase if multiple people are working on the same branch!`.

True, it's not recommended to `rebase` when multiple people are active on the same `branch`, but in this scenario `git` offers a very elegant solution: `fixup` commits. By using `fixup commits`, the branch can later go through an `interactive rebase` once the `review` process is done and the `PR` is approved.

For example: after you make your changes and stage them you can run a `git commit --fixup HEAD~` to add the changes in the last but one commit. Before the merge, you can then simply `git rebase -i <ref> --autosquash` and every change will be squashed in the correct commit.

### Why?

**Q:** Why all the hassle, does it really matter?

**A:** We've seen too many branches where `merge commits` get introduced without a good reason, too many branches that have almost the same number `merge commits` as `commits` so we want to enforce a git usage guidline that promotes responsibility. üê±‚Äçüë§

**Q:** But I want to integrate a branch, not yet merged and implement a new feature.

**A:** In this scenario, you have the `master` branch, and the `feature` branch that you depend upon. What we do in this case, is create a local branch where we merge the required `feature` branch into `master` and start our branch from there. Once the `feature` branch we depend upon, gets merged into `master`, we `rebase` over master. Easy peasy! ü§ì

**Q:** But what if I just want to add a feature?

**A:** We think that in software, it's not just about the feature, it's also about the fact that others will later on need to support that feature or modify it, having a good historical track helps everyone better understand the evolution of the codebase.
