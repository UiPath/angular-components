child.\nThis behavior results in weird jumps in certain scenarios, using scroll-into-view-if-needed helps avoid this issue.\nscroll-into-view-if-needed allows us to better control the scroll boundary

Thanks go to the @compodoc team! &#x1F44C;\nGit Conventions\nCommit Messages\nWe initially started off by using a custom commit message convention, now that we've gone OS, we realize it will be much easier for everyone if we adhere to the conventional-commit standard.\nThe project comes preconfigured with commitlint and husky hooks in order to automate checks.\nAnother advantage of conventional-commits is that it will allow us to later on integrate semantic-release with ease.\nConflict Resolution\nWe all know that once you open a PR, it sometimes goes through a rigorous code review process. Sometimes, due to this delay, we end up with a PR that has conflicts.\nIn this scenarios, we're usually used to either merge or rebase.\nWe personally prefer that branches get rebased, and usually stay away from merge commits as they mostly end up polluting the history needlessly. At this point, most of you are probabily thinking: Yeah, but it's not a good practice to rebase if multiple people are working on the same branch!.\nTrue, it's not recommended to rebase when multiple people are active on the same branch, but in this scenario git offers a very elegant solution: fixup commits. By using fixup commits, the branch can later go through an interactive rebase once the review process is done and the PR is approved.\nFor example: after you make your changes and stage them you can run a git commit --fixup HEAD~ to add the changes in the last but one commit. Before the merge, you can then simply git rebase -i  --autosquash and every change will be squashed in the correct commit.\nWhy?\nQ: Why all the hassle, does it really matter?\nA: We've seen too many branches where merge commits get introduced without a good reason, too many branches that have almost the same number merge commits as commits so we want to enforce a git usage guidline that promotes responsibility. &#x1F431;‍&#x1F464;\nQ: But I want to integrate a branch, not yet merged and implement a new feature.\nA: In this scenario, you have the master branch, and the feature branch that you depend upon. What we do in this case, is create a local branch where we merge the required feature branch into master and start our branch from there. Once the feature branch we depend upon, gets merged into master, we rebase over master. Easy peasy! &#x1F913;\nQ: But what if I just want to add a feature?\nA: We think that in software, it's not just about the feature, it's also about the fact that others will later on need to support that feature or modify it, having a good historical track helps everyone better understand the evolution of the codebase.\nComing Up (most likely v1)\n\nGetting Started / Contribution Guidlines\nEnhanced Component Demo's\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2019 UiPath Inc.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
